# Code the Future, One Line at a Time

Hi there! I'm **OP SamuelCC**, but you can call me **Samuel**. I'm a self-taught developer who enjoys building things that are useful, fun, and sometimes just cool to make. Whether itâ€™s automating tasks on Discord or designing websites from scratch, Iâ€™m all about bringing ideas to life through code.
