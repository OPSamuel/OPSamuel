<p>Hey, My name is OP SamuelCC. Commonly referred to as Samuel. I like to code things as you can see below :). I can code multi-functional discord bots that provide a wide range of services, I can also create websites using HTML & CSS, aswell as I can create simple applications in Python (I am learning it). My main language is Discord.JS, JavaScript, HTML and CSS as these were the ones that I learned first before any others. I am a fully self taught programmer in discord bot coding aswell as HTML & CSS.</p>

<p>As you can see below here are some of my basic projects that I have uploaded. Any other things I find cool will be uploaded here.</p>
